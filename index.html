			My name is Ethan, and I am a student in the Class of 2019 at the
			University of Notre Dame.

			Welcome to my website, a place to learn a bit about myself, my
			accomplishments, and what interests me. I am a computer engineering major,
			I play saxophone in the Band of the Fighting Irish, and I am a proud Eagle
			Scout. Please visit the other pages on this site to read about me in more
