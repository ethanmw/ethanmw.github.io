						Music has always been one of my biggest passions outside the classroom. I began taking piano lessons in kindergarten, and in fifth grade I picked up the saxophone. I played saxophone through high school, where I achieved Arkansas All-State honors, and when I came to Notre Dame, I joined the Band of the Fighting Irish. <img class="float-left" src="/images/band/sax.jpg" width="500"/> Through the band, I've had some incredible experiences, including marching at the 2016 Battlefrog Fiesta Bowl, marching in a parade at Walt Disney World for the 2018 Citrus Bowl, playing in Fenway Park, and performing with the Boston Pops Orchestra in Boston Symphony Hall. For my junior year, I was selected to be a member of the Irish Guard, a group of skilled marchers (approximately a dozen in number) chosen on the basis of leadership, marching ability, and spirit. The Irish Guard wear traditional highland dress featuring the university's own <a href="https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=3199">Notre Dame Marching Guard tartan</a>, perform the traditional Victory Clog to Damhsa Bua, and lead the band in march-outs and parades. I have also earned three "shamrock awards" for perfect attendance during the marching season, one for each year I have been a member of the marching band.

						In addition to the marching band, I am a member of our basketball pep band and our Symphonic Band, one of the university's auditioned concert bands. I also play in our saxophone choir, an all-saxophone ensemble including soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, and bass saxes, and in which I hope to debut an arrangment of my own this spring.
